# Routing flow: External → NodePort 32750 → Service Port 80 → TargetPort 8080 (Pods)

# All types:
  # None (default) - What you have now
    # Each request can go to any pod
    # Like a true load balancing
  # ClientIP
    # Requests from the same client IP always go to the same pod
    # Sticky sessions based on source IP
    # Good for apps that need session state (though stateless is better!)
Session Affinity:         None

# All types:
  # Cluster (default)
    # Traffic can be routed to any node, then forwarded to any pod
    # Better load distribution
    # Drawback: Source IP is lost (becomes the node's IP)
  # Local
    # Traffic only goes to pods on the same node where it arrives
    # Preserves source IP address
    # Drawback: Uneven load distribution (only local pods get traffic)
